* Shows an example of how to use NSNotificationCenter to communicate between classes or processes which have no relation between them at all. I create two different view controllers, in one there's a button and in the other one there's a label with a counter. When the user taps the button in the left view controller, the counter will start getting incremented and the label's background color will also change randomly. When the counter reaches 14, a UILabel will fade in, and when it reaches 15 it'll fade out. Written in UIKit & SwiftUI.
