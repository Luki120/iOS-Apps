# Currently

## Aurora

* A vanilla password manager (kinda, it still doesn't have autofill and all that good stuff) made both with SwiftUI and UIKit, features also a settings page with some options to customize your password.

## Cathal

* A vanilla SwiftUI app to track Pomodoro study sessions. Currently hardcoded to 60-20.

## Cora

* Shows your device's uptime in less clicks. No need to open the terminal or go through clunky menus anymore, just launch the app from your HomeScreen. It works by running the shell command you'd otherwise have to type yourself. Additionally, you can choose to show some more device specific information in the settings page.

## NSNotifsExample

* Shows an example of how to use NSNotificationCenter to communicate between classes or processes which have no relation between them at all. In my example I create two different view controllers, in one there's a button and in the other there's a label with a counter. When the user taps the button in the left view controller, the counter will start getting incremented and the labels' background color will also change randomly. When the counter reaches 14, a UILabel will fade in, and when it reaches 15 it'll fade out. Written in UIKit & SwiftUI.

## WeatherMVVM

* Shows how to use MVVM architecture (Model-View-ViewModel) in SwiftUI with a vanilla example of a weather app.

## Contributing

* Contributions are more than welcomed, but should follow this etiquette:

	* If you're a contributor with write access to this repository, you **should NOT** push to main branch, preferably push to a new one and *then* create the PR.
	* Keep commit titles short and then explain them in comments or preferably in the commit's description.
	* Push small commits (e.g if you changed 2 directories, commit one directory, then commit the other one and only THEN push)
