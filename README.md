## Aurora

* A vanilla password generator made both with SwiftUI and UIKit, features also a settings page with some options to customize your password. Maybe some day I'll make it a password manager as well.

## Cora

* Shows your device's uptime in less clicks. No need to open the terminal or go through clunky menus anymore, just launch the app from your HomeScreen. It works by running the shell command you'd otherwise have to type yourself. Additionally, you can choose to show some more device specific information in the settings page.

## NSNotifExample

* Shows an example of how to use NSNotificationCenter to communicate between classes or processes which have no relation between them at all. In my example I create two different view controllers, in one there's a button and in the other there's a text field with a counter, when the user taps the button in the left view controller, the counter will start getting incremented and the text field's background color will also change randomly. When the counter reaches 14, it'll fade in a UILabel, and when it reaches 15, it'll fade out. Written in both Objective-C and Swift.
